# tty-gpt
A simple program for communicating with chatgpt through a TTY terminal.

# To get started
## Step 1: Save the source code
Download the source code to any location on your computer.  Then, create a link to it in your `/bin` folder:

```ln -s ~/Path/to/your/file ~/bin/tty-gpt```

## Step 2: Save the API Key
Simply create an API key on your OpenAI API account.  It might look something like `sk-proj-Ktv7...`.  Save that key as a file on your computer.  The app expects the location of `.config/chatgpt/api_key`; you can modify the source code if you want to put it somewhere else.

## Step 3: Use it
In a terminal window, type `tty-gpt` and you're in gear.
Type `/help` in the app for a list of commands.
